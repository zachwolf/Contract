# Zach Wolf LLC contract

This is the standard contract to which I—acting as Zach Wolf LLC—operate.
This contract can be amended and updated to be tailored to individual clients
and projects, this is merely my boilerplate.

## Using this contract

In keeping with my sharing and open-source nature, I am making this contract
freely available for you to modify and use for yourself on your client projects.
I do, however, accept absolutely **zero liability for anything at all**. Use
entirely at your own risk.

## Thank you

With special thanks to [CSS Wizardy](https://github.com/csswizardry/Contract),
as this is just a fork of his boilerplate contract.
